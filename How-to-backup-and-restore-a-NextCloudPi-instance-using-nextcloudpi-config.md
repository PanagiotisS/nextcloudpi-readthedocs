You may want to move your NCP instance to a larger drive or restore it after a hardware failure.

To start nextcloudpi-config type following in your NCP terminal 

`sudo nextcloudpi-config`

Move up and down with arrow-keys, use tab to select(execute) or finish(cancel)

We are going to use nc-backup to back-up our NC instance to a file.

The output will confirm if operation was successful and where the backup file is stored.

This a a work in progress, thank you for your patience ;-)
