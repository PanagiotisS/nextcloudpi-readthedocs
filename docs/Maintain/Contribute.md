感謝你為 NextCloud 貢獻！這裡有許多事情可以為 NextCloudPi 貢獻。

## 回報臭蟲 (Bugs)
We try to test things out before we ship updates but we don't have the required time to test everything out. Reporting Bugs is one helpful thing you can do. It helps us maintain our project and  If you use NextcloudPi and find that something isn't working properly, please report it to our [Issues](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues) page. *Before reporting a bug check if it is already answered in [here](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%20label:question%20) or in the [FAQ](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/wiki/FAQ)*

## 提出建議
An other thing you can do is propose things you would like to see in NextCloudPi Project. If you have something in your mind, Send a [feature request](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label:%22feature%20request%22%20), or just talk about your thoughts in the [forums](https://help.nextcloud.com/c/support/appliances-docker-snappy-vm). The more different ideas are put on the table the better.

## 協助
As every open source project, we need manpower. If you have the coding skills to fix a bug you run into yourself, send a Pull Request. Even better, browse the issue tracker, chat with other developers or propose changes.

## 分享
Even if everything goes smooth for you and you do not have the time or the skills to do any of the above, it is really easy to help. Share the latest torrent! Be aware that every now and then, we will release a new image, so the old torrent will no longer be available in the project page.

## 告訴你的朋友
如果您對 Nextcloud 和 NextCloudPi 感到滿意，你可以在平常聊天時告訴你的朋友。
