## Hi, I'm looking to use NextcloudPi; should I use a Raspberry Pi?

You certainly can!  The latest Pi model will have better performance, but has a few downsides as nicely described in _[What's Wrong with the Raspberry Pi](https://ownyourbits.com/2019/02/02/whats-wrong-with-the-raspberry-pi/)_.

- Pi 3b+ is a decent choice with gigabit networking, but there are better options!
- Pi 2 works just okay.
- Pi 3 works slightly better than the 2 model.
- Pi Zero W has very low performance.

## Best ARM Device for NextcloudPi

The best ARM device is not a Raspberry Pi!  Surprise!  It is a great device, but [competition is heavy these days](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/best-cheap-hardware-to-run-nextcloud-on). </br></br>

For price vs. performance the most popular NextcloudPi ARM Devices are:

- [Rock64](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=7147) -- same price as the Raspberry Pi 3b
- [ODROID HC-1]() -- 2.5" Hard Disk support for $49.00
- [ODROID HC-2](https://ameridroid.com/products/odroid-hc1) -- 3.5" Hard Disk support for $55.00
